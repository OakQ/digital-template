<h2>BreakOut: Ghost Rebellions</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The classic Breakout game with traps and challenges.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Light sense of spook and the desire to keep playing until they win
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Classic Arcade game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the Paddle and must bounce the ball around the screen to try to destroy all the Bricks. However, in this variant, there are also Ghosts, X Blocks, and TNT. The Ghosts lower your score, the TNT causes you to lose a life, and the X Block bounces your ball off without being destoryed. To win the game, all Blocks excpet for the Ghosts and X Blocks must be destroyed. Run out of lives and you lose the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The basic paddle-and-ball mechanic redefined with bricks and tricks
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
In most parts, it greatly resembles the classic BreakOut game, but differs in that each block, except for the Brick has a unique effect on the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in a dystopian society run by ghosts. In this society there is a group of rebels known as the Ball Brothers who want to overthrow the ghosts and put the rightful heir to the Paddle throne, Pad, back in power.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In a world where ghosts rule and paddles drool, one paddle stands out among the rest as the hero who will save the world. In order to banish the ghosts back to the Spooky Realm, Pad, the paddle, must unite with a rag-tag group of vigilantes, the Ball brothers in order to destroy their Bricks while avoiding the ghosts themselves. Many obstacles lie in their way, and even more traps. Will Pad and the Ball Brothers save the world? Or will they get spooked trying?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
General Audiences
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
No longer than 5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Learning how the ball bounces off the paddle and manipulating that to bounce the ball exactly where the player wants it to go
